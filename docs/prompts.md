This will be a reactive website for an event at a school. The event is a series of sports such as Volleyball, Soccer Boal, Basketball and others. This website will need an Admin panel an a Public one. Registries at Login system will be made by me. Use Tailwind CSS and the NextJS Base already present, but also use Convex.

Create a page to show the Teams and current members of it. Another page for the matches with this teams. At the Admin panel there will be the registry of teams, when info about a match such as points and penalities. Points will be put live so put an timestamp at each creation.

New packages or running services you request to me, dont run it.

It did its job faster than Kilo ever could with even less requests, i didn't get rate limited so upside! But the interface was the most basic it could ever be and Convex registry didn't work at all. I never messed with convex and just a little with NextJS but for this shitty work, my thoughts are that or this model SUCK a lot or AI Vibecoded shit isn't really a 10x dev is just an 0.1x instead.

I will save this but maybe i will need to make this myself and some help of GPT 5 Mini along the way to create an good UI and a working project.
