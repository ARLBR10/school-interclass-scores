# Project making

# Day 1
20:10 - Started the project. Github Copilot suggested to create an [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../.github/copilot-instructions.md)
20:03 - GPT 5 Mini is cooking with UI/UX and is not even the full model or at a high reasoning! 
20:18 - Got to dinner!
21:00 - I am back! Just making some commit
21:27 - Distracted.. (I am fucked on a school job. Well i guess i will need to do some miracle!)

# Day 2
~18:00 - Started with Convex Schema creation, lets have the backend working then we work around the frontend.
18:34 - Schema Done, i may need to add some things at a future but it works.
18:36 - GPT 5 Mini help to fix Mobile view.
18:47 - Good work on the mobile view, just need a fix at the alignment of the icons
18:48 - Did it correct! I will just ask to make the menu bigger and also the text
(midnight of the next day)
00:30 - I forgot to update this file! Well i was creating some of the routes to get All the `matches` and `teams`.
00:45 - GPT 5 Mini to create the UI for matches!
01:05 - It did it, but it didn't open had some wrong wizard spell with convex so make it static with a list!
01:10 - Do it again
01:15 - Implement details button
01:40 - Asked to do teams page, it did, and implemented the Details tab out of the box! Pretty good!

# Day 3
16:56 - After a lot of tries with Vercel on my cellphone it could finally fix Convex error at vercel deploy!
17:00 - Vercel Analytics because FUCK YOU GOOGLE! (I am just lazy)
17:05 - Convex component to allow use of their API. I hope i didn't integrate wrong and have stability issues later the road.
17:08 - This time i didn't get errors trying to use an Convex API.
18:56 - Finalized the Recent Match to main page (i think it was easier that it really is)
19:08 - Starting custom team pages, found a rather strange thing GPT 5 Mini did with ID parameter
20:44 - Teams page is going in wrong is so many ways! First convex decided to not show the INFO chatgpt fixed it by broking my brain
20:46 - He did an skeleton pre rendering so i am happy
21:08 - Translation in a Utils file so i don't have to hardcode some things.
21:23 - Teams page now isn't static anymore!
21:28 - GPT 5 Mini hardcoded some of the skeletons....
21:39 - Fixed players being just DB IDs and now have names!
21:51 - I may be using to much of GPT abilities...
22:00 - He messed up a little with the instruction the padronize the color system, and update the score system at the matches page.

# Day 4
15:00 - Have hell of a lot of thing to put in the website
15:15 - Fixed match events.
15:19 - Team matches on work
16:17 - Hell of a lot of time to integrate this matches of a team!
16:19 - Lets go the matches info. 
16:24 - GPT 5 Mini started to build a convex function, i stopped him to me integrate my way and just create a static object based on the convex schema
16:27 - He did it again! Am i bad at writing prompts?
16:30 - AGAIN!?!?
20:31 - After so much pain with GPT 5 Mini to do what it was told, i ve finished the match page, now lets go to the match list.

# Day 5 
18:20 - Quite late start today! We need to do:
- [x] Fix player list to include class
- [x] The Players page (GPT 5 Mini) already made the base, just convex now.
- [x] The clerk auth with Convex, i saw at the gym shouldn't be a worry
- [ ] The Admin page to register matches 
- [ ] Something to auto do the Status field at Convex from a match
- [ ] Try out next match function
18:39 - Fix player list to include class
- [ ] Add matches (possibly) to player list
- [ ] Fix unknown id with convex to not just error out.
18:57 - Trying to use Zed, VSCode is just superior at Intellisense but AI Integration even with copilot to zed is just Greater than VSCode standard.
19:03 - Some progress with Clerk
- [x] Fix error with token after signed in. (Needed to fix at convex dashboard)
20:22 - Clerk white theme was so bad! Dark theme now!
20:23 - Disabled "ClassificaÃ§Ã£o" page from layout.

21:23 - Lets get to work with Admin page.
21:58 - GPT 5 Mini is using something different at Zed

# Day 6
18:04 - I didn't need to fix or add Admin panel, because 'mans' (a lot of people of the male sex) can't go to the competition anymore since today the School director doesn't have the capacity to just punish 2/3 classes (ðŸ«¥) and prefer to have all the man from all the classes just don't see or play any of the games anymore! Even when there sex is not playing!!!!!
18:16 - Lets do the TODOs from a day ago (little update)
- [ ] Create a live route to always go to the next Schedule match or Started Match
