## FAQ

Q: **Why not vibecoded it?**
A: Well... I tried doing this but, i didn't have a good model available and [Sonoma Sky Alpha](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/sonoma-sky-alpha) (Anonymous model that is probably an Grok 5 or 4.20) is free but sucked. See branch [`third_try`](https://github.com/ARLBR10/school-interclass-scores/tree/third_try) to see what this FUCKING SHITTY model gave me.

Q: **There is AI at least?**
A: I am writing this before i even started to code but i probably use [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) with GPT 5 Mini to create the UI/UX and learn about convex.

Q: **Languages and Products in use?**
A: [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Convex (for backend)](https://www.convex.dev/), package management with [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), and runner will be [BunJS](https://bun.com/)
